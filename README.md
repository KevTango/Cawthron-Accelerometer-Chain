# Cawthron Accelerometer Chain

## Author: Kevin Tang

### I wrote this code for Cawthron Institute during my internship, it is to measure the acceleration at 10 different points of the mussel farm rope and to log the data on a single SD card.

The file has three folders: 

* `receiver` for the receiver component measuring the acceleration and the temperature
* `datalogger` for requesting the data from the receiver and to log them on the SD card
* `PCB` containing the PCB files

## Code Setup

* Download uPycraft IDE

* Copy respective files (main.py + boot.py + libraries) to SD card

**NOTE: If SD card is larger than 32GB, use GUIFormat to format SD card to FAT32**
